text \<open>This theory captures the definition of an algebraic algorithm according to 
Fuchsbauer, Kiltz, and Loss: The Algebraic Group Model and its Applications
https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/620.pdf

(* Erw√§hne functions *)

We provide dynamic ML functions to enforce the rules of an algebraic algorithm on 
arbitrary algorithms thereby practically lifting adversaries from the standard model 
to the algebraic group model.
